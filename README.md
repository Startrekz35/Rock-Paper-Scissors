Rock, Paper, Scissors Game
Description
Welcome to the Rock, Paper, Scissors game, a simple and fun console-based implementation of the classic game! In this version, you can play against the computer, and the program will randomly select its choice. Your task is to beat the computer by choosing wisely!

How to Play

When you run the program, you'll be greeted with a welcome message.
You will be prompted to choose between:
0 for Rock
1 for Paper

The computer will also make a random selection.

The game will display both your choice and the computer's choice using ASCII art.

The result will be determined and displayed:
Draw: if both you and the computer select the same option.

Loss: if the computer's choice beats yours.
